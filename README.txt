Plugin for Thunderbird.

To make it work:
1) launch the daemon:
> sh launchdaemon.sh
2) copy folder getdns@exascale.info into ~/.thunderbird/???/extensions/ (??? is your profile id, usually there is only one folder) 
3) launch thunderbird, agree to install new extension
4) click on any message, you should see red or green getDNS label next to the sender label.
